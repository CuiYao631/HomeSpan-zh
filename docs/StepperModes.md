# Stepper Motor Modes

A typical 4-wire stepper motors has 2 independent sets of coils, *A* and *B*.  A driver chip, which usually contains two full-bridge circuits, controls the amount and direction of current flowing through each coil.  When one or both coils are energized, a magnetic field is created with a repeating pattern of peaks and valleys
